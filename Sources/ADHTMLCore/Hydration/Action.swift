// A typed, Swift-authored client action (RFC-0019 §3.1/§6.3-F). An `Action` is a client-issued request
// bound to a DOM event, whose `text/html` response is applied to a target region. It lowers to a closed
// set of `data-adh-*` attributes (the shared wire, contract C3) that the runtime's delegated listener
// interprets — the JS side is `action.js`, and `Action.methods` ↔ `ACTION_METHODS` are kept in sync by a
// parity test, exactly like `Behavior` ↔ `behaviors.js`. The verb set is CLOSED (get/post/put/patch/
// delete) so the runtime stays a tiny generic interpreter and illegal verbs can't be authored.
//
// This is the realization of ADR-0044/0048's deferred "first-party client-action DSL" — htmx's
// capability with ADHTML's ergonomics (Swift-typed, one wire format), not an untyped attribute soup.
// Static fallback is preserved by construction: without the runtime the element still behaves natively
// (an input inside a `<form>` submits), so every action degrades to a server round-trip.
